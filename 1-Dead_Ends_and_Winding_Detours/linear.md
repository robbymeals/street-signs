## _Linear_

### What you think it means:
_Linear_: involving lines in some way 

### What it actually means:
_Linear_ is the grandaddy of all Winding Detours. It is everywhere,
and its actual meaning in any given context is often deceptively complex. 
You probably were pretty confident in your grasp of the concept of a _line_,
and the general idea of _linearity_, since you first learned geometry. But
if you are really paying attention, you will probably lose
that confidence at some point. Since the various uses of the word 
actually are all subtly related, and some of them are the fundamental
conceptual building block of an entire branch of high-level mathematics, 
this should be pretty easy to write. Here goes.

In likely its most confusing appearance for the uninitiated, it shows up in 
one of the actual name of _linear_ algebra. It is ubiquitous in statistics,
where it gets to mean a few different things and common in many other areas.
The key thing to understand about the majority of the appearances of
_linear_ is that __it is usually metaphorical__, as in "you know those _line_
things you understand already? This is kind of like that, sort of."
In most cases, the word has been appropriated not because there will actually
be any lines anywhere, but because the goal is to get you to
take the intuitive concept and behavior of a _line_ and using it as a bridge 
to gain understanding of more complex concepts, structures or behaviour.

### Excrutiating Details
####_Linear_ Algebra
Protip: If we were naming "_Linear_ Algebra" today, its name would be
"Vector Algebra" or "Vector Space Algebra", since that is actually what it is 
all about.
It is called _linear_ algebra for two main reasons: first, because a book with 
that title was written in 1882, before the whole vector space thing got fully 
fleshed out (in 1888); and second, because a useful way to first grasp the 
concept of a "vector" is to think of them as a generalization of a _line_ into 
any dimension.
This ends up not being true, exactly, as the concept of a vector doesn't need 
to have any geometric interpretation at all, but it is a useful metaphor. 
So just accept that like all metaphors, it will eventually fail you, let it 
take you as far as it can, and abandon it when it is no longer useful.
