# Unpacking the Overloaded

"No, no. Same words, completely unrelated."

"You're going to want to just forget the original meaning of that word for now."

"Yes, actually. There IS a very interesting explanation why those things share
the same name. You see, in 1947, in the deepest, darkest basements of MIT..." 

"Oh, right, sorry. Yep, those five things with six different names are 
actually all just the one exact same thing. I thought someone had told you."

I am sure the experience is common to learning in many areas, but it does seem
that the people doing the thinking at the intersections of math, 
computer science, machine learning, statistics, econometrics, 
operations research and other math and data-heavy fields take special pleasure 
in needlessly tormenting the uninitiated with words. 
The goal herein is to attack five special types of needless, harmful 
complexity with simple, intuitive explanations that reduce the cognitive 
load of acquiring knowledge in these here intellectual parts, supplemented
with detailed, obsessive explanations for the insatiable and the bad-at-parties.

More and more people are travelling on the roads between these disciplines,
starting off with varying degrees of foundational knowledge, self-confidence
and support. They would be difficult enough to navigate if they were all 
mapped, marked and signed to perfection. 
My metaphorical call to arms, flogged though it may be, is this: 
we may never be rid of all these pedogical potholes and speedbumps, but 
good lord, people, we can at least post some signs.

We will call our five villains by these names:

1. Confounders: same or similar words, completely unrelated 
1. Rabbit Holes: same words, uselessly or tangentially related
1. Hoodwinks: completely different words, same thing or highly related
1. Chimeras: when two sets of terminology and notation ARE badly unified 
1. Left Fields: common notation or terminology that just comes out of nowhere 

As my collection of these evil little bastards grows, I may do something a bit
more presentable with them. I have a vague vision of a tiny little orange 
reference book that can be handed to people emerging from their disciplinary
silos, when they first ask what the difference is between a logistic 
regression and a maxent classifier.
