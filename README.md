### Helping You Avoid the Hazards 
### on The Roads to Machine Learning Knowledge

"Ah. No, no. Same words, completely unrelated."

"You're going to want to just forget the original meaning of that word 
for now."

"Yes, actually. There IS a very interesting explanation why those things share
the same name. You see, on May 7th, 1932, Claude Shannon and R. A. Fisher
were playing a game of their own invention, the rules of which were
loosely based on chess but far more complicated, when..." 

"Oh, right, sorry. Yep, those five things with six different names are 
actually all just the one exact same thing. I thought someone had told you."

I am sure the experience is common to learning in many areas, but it does seem
that the people doing the thinking at the intersections of math, 
computer science, machine learning, statistics, econometrics, 
operations research and other math and data-heavy fields take special pleasure 
in needlessly tormenting the uninitiated with words. 
The goal herein is to attack some specific types of needless, harmful 
complexity with simple, intuitive explanations that reduce the cognitive 
load of acquiring knowledge in these here intellectual parts, supplemented
with detailed, obsessive explanations for the insatiable and the bad-at-parties.

We will call our villains by these names:

1. [Dead Ends](1-Dead_Ends/0-README.md): same or similar words, completely unrelated 
1. [Winding Roads](2-Winding_Roads/0-README.md): same words, uselessly or tangentially related
1. [Roundabouts](3-Roundabouts/0-README.md): completely different words, same thing or highly related
1. [Lane Mergers](4-Lane_Mergers/0-README.md): when two sets of terminology and notation are badly or 
   inconsistently unified 
1. [Falling Rocks](5-Falling_Rocks/0-README.md): common notation or terminology that just seems to comes out 
   of nowhere 

As our collection of these evil little bastards grows, we may do something a bit
more presentable with them. There exists a vague vision of a tiny little orange 
reference book that can be handed to people embarking on their journey
or  emerging from their disciplinary silos, 
when, for instance, they first ask what the difference is between a logistic 
regression and a maxent classifier.

In summary: More and more people are travelling on the roads 
towards and between these disciplines,
starting off with varying degrees of foundational knowledge, self-confidence
and support. These travelers would encounter more than enough difficulty 
navigating if all their routes were mapped, marked and signed to perfection. 
My metaphorical call to arms, flogged though it may be, is this: 
we may never be rid of all these pedogical hazards entirely, but 
good lord, people, we can at least post some signs.
