### Avoid the Lexical Hazards on The Journey <br> to Machine Learning Knowledge
<hr>

"Ah. No, no. Same words, completely unrelated."

"You're going to want to just forget the original meaning of that word 
for now."

"Yes, actually. There IS a very interesting explanation why those things share
the same name. You see, on May 7th, 1932, in a sub-basement at Bell Labs,
Claude Shannon and Alan Turing were playing a game of their own invention, 
loosely based on chess but far more complicated, when Von Neuman walked in..." 

"Oh. Right. Sorry. Yes, those five things with six different names are 
actually all just the one exact same thing. I thought someone had told you."

"Yeah, see, it's because Fisher was kind of a dick."

Becoming proficient in machine learning requires the acquisition of a lot
of foundational knowledge, from a whole lot of areas, most especially linear
algebra, statistics and general computer science. On top of that, so much work
that is called "machine learning" or that machine learning techniques are
derived from is done in disciplines and professions that are at most 
tangentially related to one of those original three areas.
All this interdisciplinary intermingling and cross fertilization is one
of the things that makes machine learning such an exciting area to work in.
But it also sure as hell makes things more confusing.
I am sure this is common to learning in many areas, but it does seem
that the people doing the thinking, writing and teaching at the intersections 
of math, computer science, machine learning, statistics, econometrics, 
operations research, finance and other data-centric fields that take 
special pleasure in needlessly tormenting the uninitiated with words. 
The goal herein is to attack some specific types of particularly insidious 
["terminological inexactitude"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminological_inexactitude) 
faced by people learning in these areas with simple, intuitive explanations 
that reduce the cognitive load of acquiring knowledge. 
These will be supplemented, where appropriate, with obsessively detailed 
explanations for the insatiable and the bad-at-parties.

So far, we have examples in these broadly defined areas:

1. [Dead Ends](1-Dead_Ends_and_Winding_Roads/0-intro.md): same or similar words, 
   completely unrelated 
1. [Winding Roads](1-Dead_Ends_and_Winding_Roads/0-intro.md): same words, uselessly 
   or tangentially related
1. [Roundabouts](2-Roundabouts_and_Lane_Mergers/0-intro.md): completely different words, same 
   thing or highly related
1. [Lane Mergers](2-Roundabouts_and_Lane_Mergers/0-intro.md): when two sets of terminology and
   notation are badly or inconsistently unified 
1. [Falling Rocks](3-Falling_Rocks/0-intro.md): common notation or terminology 
   that just seems to comes out of nowhere

There will be definitely be significant overlap, cross-reference, subsumption,
supersumption within and between the topics under those headings, but we have
to start somewhere and we were able to shove these into the overarching 
metaphor with only a lot of awkwardness. Some Dead Ends are also Winding Roads, 
some Roundabouts reference Dead Ends and Winding Roads, etc, etc, etc.
The product of these efforts will likely be some beastly hybrid of a glossary, 
an etymology, a cheat sheet, a pocket reference and a curiousity cabinet.
There exists a vague vision of a tiny little orange book that can be handed to 
people embarking on their journey or emerging from their disciplinary silos, 
when, for instance, they first ask what the difference is between a logistic 
regression and a maxent classifier. 

Some of the examples included will be so obvious to long-time practicioners 
of the data arts that they will seem ludicrous. These, we believe, are among
the most important, as they are often the most bewildering to new learners.
Others will be controversial to members of particular disciplines. These are
also important, as some disciplines are especially bad actors, words-wise. 
And some examples included will be completely incorrect, because your authors 
thinks they know some stuff they do not in fact know. 
In the interest of making this compendium as useful as possible - and
because we are starved for attention - we welcome argument, feedback, 
corrections, death threats and any other communication in any form containing 
any content. Mostly we just want comments, pull requests and issues, though. 

My metaphorical call to arms, flogged though it may be, is this: 
more and more people are travelling on the roads towards and 
between the data-driven disciplines, starting off with varying degrees of 
foundational knowledge, self-confidence and support. 
These travelers would have difficulty enough navigating 
if those building the roads had all worked together, using high-quality
geographic surveys and modern construction equipment.
But just like our actual roads, these highways to knowledge are artifacts
of politics, ignorance, badly-executed good intentions and bad intentions,
executed well. They wind for no reason, they take random detours and sometimes
they crumble beneath us. Some of these issues are getting better and 
inter-disciplinary cooperation, collaboration and standardization is becoming
more and more common. But there are still a lot of shitty roads getting built
even as we speak. So we may never be rid of all these pedogical hazards. 
But good lord, people, we can at least post some signs.
