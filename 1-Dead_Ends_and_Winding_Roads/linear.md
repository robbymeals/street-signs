## _Linear_
_Linear_ is probably the grandaddy of all Winding Roads. It is everywhere
and its actual meaning is often deceptively complex, depending on the context. 
You probably were pretty confident in your grasp of the concept of a _line_,
and the general idea of _linearity_, since you first learned geometry. But
if you were really paying attention along the way, you probably lost that
confidence at some point. Since all the various uses of the word are in 
some way related in subtle ways that are in some cases the fundamental
conceptual building block of an entire branch of high-level mathematics, 
this is a damned difficult example to write, if I am being completlely honest. 

In likely its most confusing appearance for the uninitiated, it shows up in 
one of the actual name of _linear_ algebra. It is ubiquitous in statistics,
where it gets to mean a few different things and common in many other areas.
The key thing to understand about the majority of the appearances of
_linear_ in your studies is that __it is usually metaphorical in some way__.
Usually, the word has been appropriated because the goal is to get you to i
take the intuitive concept and behavior of a _line_ and using it as a bridge 
to work with more complex concepts, structures or behaviour.

###_Linear_ Algebra
If we were naming "_Linear_ Algebra" today, we would probably call it 
"Vector Algebra" or "Vector Space Algebra", since that is what it is all about.
It is called _linear_ algebra for two main reasons: first, because a book with 
that title was written in 1882, before the whole vector space thing got fully 
fleshed out (in 1888); and second, because a useful way to first grasp the 
concept of a "vector" is to think of them as a generalization of a _line_ into 
any dimension.
This ends up not being true, exactly, as the concept of a vector doesn't need 
to have any geometric interpretation at all, but it is a useful metaphor. 
So just accept that like all metaphors, it will eventually fail you, let it 
take you as far as it can, and abandon it when it is no longer useful.
